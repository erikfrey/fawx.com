fawx.com - erik's super old barely maintained website

This repo uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static website into the `gh-pages` branch.

It uses a [fork](https://github.com/erikfrey/hugo-nederburg-theme) of the [hugo nederburg theme](https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-theme) with a few small tweaks.
