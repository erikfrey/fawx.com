I'm an engineer that builds products powered by artificial intelligence.

Currently: I build products that [talk to people](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/).  I also build [simulators](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/07/speeding-up-reinforcement-learning-with.html) that teach robots to operate in physical spaces.

Previously: I built a [better doctor's office](https://goforward.com).  I designed massive scale [urban hardware](https://www.sidewalklabs.com/).  I taught computers to [read the news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavii), and also to [find your next favorite song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm).

I live in California with my wife [Naola](https://profiles.stanford.edu/naola-austin), our kiddo, and two unruly dogs.
