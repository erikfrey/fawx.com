I'm an engineer building artificial intelligence.

Currently: I teach robots to do useful things using [simulation](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/07/speeding-up-reinforcement-learning-with.html).

Previously: I built products that [talk to people](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/).  I built a [better doctor's office](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/15/forward-health-carepod-ai-doctor/).  I designed massive scale [urban hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk_Labs).  I taught computers to [read the news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavii), and also to [find your next favorite song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm).

I live with my [daughter](/hi-kiddo) in California.
