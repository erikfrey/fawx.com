I maintain this website mostly out of nostalgia and loyalty to a past self that believed websites were an important part of one's legacy.  Most of these posts are dated from years or decades ago - messages in a bottle from an old, long-expired Erik.

Now I spend more effort on living a meaningful life, and less effort on documenting it.  That has worked out, more or less.
